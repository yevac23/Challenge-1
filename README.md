# Challenge-1: Accesibility Challenge

## Description
This assignment was mainly focused on how to improve and refactor a script of code. I learned how to refactor, increase accesibility, and improve my overall code. With the provided HTML and CSS sheet, I was able to change around a few things and make pieces of the code more compact and direct.

## Changes in the HTML:
- Applied semantic HTML elements such as nav, header, and footer.
- Added alt tags to img elements.
- Made the title more specific and appropriate.
- Made the heading attributes fall in sequential order.
- Adjusted the structure of HTML elements to follow the order of styling.

## Changes in the CSS:
- Removed repeated elements and compacted them into one selector.
